----push---

# push to master, two methods
# origin: is an option: refers to our git repository
# main: is the branch that we want to push to.
# rk: when doing a pull request, do not push on master but on a new branch created previously to any changes from clone
git push origin main
git push

# use option -u (for upstream) set the default branch to push to when just using "gi push"
# synonymes:-u and --set-upstream
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin branch1

# to initialise a new git repo from non git dir, enter the dir and write
git init

# use remote to link the new git dir to github repo, to be able to push
git remote origin git@repofromgithubcreatedrepo

----branch----

# switch between branches/ create new branches : use git checkout
# to create a new branch, use option -b
